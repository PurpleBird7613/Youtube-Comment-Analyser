## Project Overview
The YouTube Comment Analyzer is a powerful tool that helps analyze and categorize comments on YouTube videos. This project takes a YouTube video link as input, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze all the comments, and categorizes them into different categories such as good comments, bad comments, suggestions, requests, and more based on the comment context.

## How it Works

### 1. Input
Provide a YouTube video link as input.

### 2. Comment Collection
The tool collects all the comments from the YouTube video.

### 3. LLM Analysis
The Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes each comment to understand its context and sentiment.

### 4. Categorization
The tool categorizes each comment into different categories such as:
* Good comments
* Bad comments
* Suggestions
* Requests
* and more...

### 5. Report Generation
The tool generates a comprehensive report of the analyzed comments, including the categorization and sentiment analysis (Final report in .html for easy viewing...).

### 6. Output
The report is saved to a file for further analysis or review.
